# Article 2: Ownership

## Declaration
Owning personal data means having the right to fully control it, much like control over oneâ€™s own body. There is the right to retain it, use it as desired, share it, or even delete it if so chosen. Personal data can be passed on to others and its value can be utilized. In essence, this data belongs to the individual to manage, protect, and decide how it is used.
