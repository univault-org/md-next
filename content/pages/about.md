# About Univault Research Lab

## Our Mission

Univault Research Lab is a research initiative dedicated to advancing personal data sovereignty and consciousness-aware AI technologies. We research, develop, and publish technologies that put individuals in control of their digital lives while enabling breakthrough AI capabilities.

## Who We Are

We are a research lab focused on developing technologies across multiple domains:
- **Consciousness & AI Research** - Exploring consciousness-aware AI, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced learning encoders
- **Data Sovereignty Research** - Developing technologies for personal data ownership and privacy-preserving AI systems
- **Protocol & Security Research** - Innovating secure communication protocols and cryptographic solutions

Our research spans from foundational models like the General Learning Encoder (GLE) to practical applications in hardware-to-AI transformation.

## What We Do

### Research & Development

We conduct research and publish findings across three main areas:

**Consciousness & AI Research:**
- Complete AI Architecture (GPT + Harmonic Frequency - HF Models + Adapter)
- General Learning Encoder (GLE) - Pre-trained foundation model for subject-invariant EEG intelligence
- Breathing Authentication - 96.8% accuracy biometric identification (Current Biology 2025)
- EEG Foundation Challenge 2025 - Verified benchmarks exceed winning solutions

**Data Sovereignty Research:**
- Personal AI Systems that maintain individual data ownership
- Privacy-preserving architectures for personal data management
- Data standards for personal data sovereignty

**Protocol & Security Research:**
- Satellite Relay Package Transfer Protocol (SRPT)
- Quantum-safe privacy solutions
- Secure data sharing protocols

### Applications of Our Research

Our research powers several applications:
- **[Bagle.com](https://bagle.com)** - Hardware-to-AI transformation platform powered by GLE
- **MirrorAI** - Complete AI applications for mental coaching and personal development
- **RIIF** - Audio player platform for personalized content delivery

## Our Vision

We envision a future where:
- Every individual owns and controls their personal data
- AI systems are consciousness-aware and respect personal data sovereignty
- Research breakthroughs enable practical applications that benefit individuals
- Digital identities are preserved and protected across generations

## Core Principles

### 1. Ownership
We believe personal data belongs to individuals, giving them complete control over how it's used, shared, and preserved.

### 2. Privacy
Like DNA passed through generations, personal data carries unique information that defines us and must be protected accordingly.

### 3. Security
We implement robust security measures to protect personal data at every stage—from generation to storage.

### 4. Universal Access
We ensure personal data can be accessed securely by authorized AI systems and services while maintaining individual control.

## Research Publications

Our research findings are published and verified:
- **EEG Foundation Challenge 2025** - Verified benchmarks available in our [open-source repository](https://github.com/paragon-dao/eeg-foundation-challenge-2025)
- **Breathing Authentication** - Published in Current Biology (2025)
- **GLE Technology** - Foundation model for subject-invariant EEG intelligence
