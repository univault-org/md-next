# About Univault

## Our Mission

At Univault, we're pioneering the future of personal data sovereignty in the age of artificial intelligence. We believe that every individual should have complete control over their digital identity, just as they have autonomy over their physical selves.

## Who We Are

We are a collective of researchers, technologists, and digital rights advocates working to create a universal standard for personal data management. Our team is united by the belief that personal data sovereignty is a fundamental right in the digital age.

## What We Do

### Research & Development
We're developing a resilient, distributed, and decentralized system that enables:
- Universal access to personal data for AI training
- Secure data storage and processing
- Individual control over data sharing
- Long-term preservation of digital identity

### Digital Rights Advocacy
Through our Universal Declaration of Digital Rights, we're establishing foundational principles for:
- Data Ownership
- Privacy Protection
- Security Standards
- Access Rights

## Our Vision

We envision a future where:
- Every individual owns and controls their personal data vault
- AI systems respect personal data sovereignty
- Digital identities are preserved across generations
- Data sharing is transparent, secure, and revocable

## Core Principles

### 1. Ownership
We believe personal data belongs to individuals, giving them complete control over how it's used, shared, and preserved.

### 2. Privacy
Like DNA passed through generations, personal data carries unique information that defines us and must be protected accordingly.

### 3. Security
We implement robust security measures to protect personal data at every stage—from generation to storage.

### 4. Universal Access
We ensure personal data can be accessed securely by authorized AI systems and services while maintaining individual control.
